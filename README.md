Análsis de datos - accidentes en Bélgica

In this prelimary exploratory work we take a closer look at variabilty amongst the number of accidents in Belgium along a spatial (variation among districts?) and temporal axis (variation over the years?, variation between working period vs. holidays?). Whilst variation of the years is clearly confirmed, variation among districts is also visible. These can be related to specific reasons. The holiday months vs. other months do not show a convincing difference at first side.
