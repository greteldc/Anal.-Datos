**Análisis preliminar de datos** - variación en el número de accidentes en Bélgica

Preliminar data analysis - variation in the number of accidents in Belgium

In this prelimary exploratory work we take a closer look at variability amongst the number of accidents in Belgium along a spatial (variation among districts?) and temporal axis (variation over the years?, variation between working period vs. holidays?). Variation over the years is clearly confirmed, variation among districts is also visible. These can be related to specific reasons. Significance of the holiday months vs. other months in the number of accidents needs further exploration.
